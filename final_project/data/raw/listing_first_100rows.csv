Hosting through Airbnb has created a wonderful opportunity to meet people from all over the world, plot their addresses, and  learn about other places.

There is an awesome Tenement Museum now on Orchard street, not far from my apartment. The Lower East Side has, in my opinion, two identities. The eastern side is very residential. The western, more in part is a hip, night time destinations with many bars, restaurants, galleries, cafes, independent shops, etc. My apartment is a couple of minutes from the hip part.  My particular street is very much in transition definitely going through gentrification. My block has now three renovated buildings, including mine and I suspect in a few years, will be completely different.  My immediate neighborhood is a mix of people - a real reflection of NYC diversity - Asian, Latin, Jewish, Black, young professionals, hipsters, artists, etc. It's a cool mix. The street is urban for sure but very safe. My building is filled with young professionals, creative types - one married co	This is my personal apartment. It's not a business. It's not a hotel. It's not perfect. I host often and keep up with my place because of that. I try to keep it as clean as possible. However, it does have imperfections like anyone's home. If you expect perfection, it's best you book a hotel. :)	F train, East Broadway stop is seconds away, very convenient and per my reviews, one of the things people love about my place.  The East Broadway stop is the last stop in Manhattan before it heads to Dumbo in Brooklyn The F train also goes up the center of Manhattan and can take you to the East Village, Soho, West Village, Chelsea, Time Square, Rockefeller Center and the southern part of Central Park. It's the best train! :)	Guests have access to the whole apartment.	This listing is for the whole apartment I will not be staying there. I will check in sporadically during your stay and if in town, during your stay, am accessible anytime.	No smoking in apartment. No Pets allowed.

WHY WILLIAMSBURG?

Williamsburg is FABULOUS. It's fast growing and it's fast changing. It's hip. In the 1960's the new and exciting place where culture was blooming was Greenwich Village. In the 70's the SOHO neighborhood was where cheap industrial loft space were being turned into places where the adventurous could move to New York, live cheaply and make the new art, music, and culture. These days Williamsburg has that special chemistry of the New York that's constantly renewing itself.

There is an awesome Tenement Museum now on Orchard street, not far from my apartment. The Lower East Side has, in my opinion, two identities. The eastern side is very residential. The western, more in part is a hip, night time destinations with many bars, restaurants, galleries, cafes, independent shops, etc. My apartment is a couple of minutes from the hip part.  My particular street is very much in transition definitely going through gentrification. My block has now three renovated buildings, including mine and I suspect in a few years, will be completely different.  My immediate neighborhood is a mix of people - a real reflection of NYC diversity - Asian, Latin, Jewish, Black, young professionals, hipsters, artists, etc. It's a cool mix.

If you expect perfection, it's best you book a hotel. :)	F train, East Broadway stop is seconds away, very convenient and per my reviews, one of the things people love about my place.  The East Broadway stop is the last stop in Manhattan before it heads to Dumbo in Brooklyn The F train also goes up the center of Manhattan and can take you to the East Village, Soho, West Village, Chelsea, Time Square, Rockefeller Center and the southern part of Central Park. It's the best train! :)	Guests have access to the whole apartment.	As we will be sharing the apartment, interaction is a given.

I rent out my apartment two ways - as a full on rental during the year when I am traveling, or as a shared situation for those traveling alone and want a safe, clean, cool place to crash while you are checking out NYC.

My house has been used for filming scenes for Sex & The City, The Sopranos, Gossip Girl & White Collar.

I love Asian, Spanish & Cuban food, along with a good bottle of red wine.
Talking about travel, art, design and photography are my favorite subjects.

Our neighborhood is called Bedford Stuyvesant: it is African American, Caribbean, and African, with plenty of music, a plethora of European and ethnic restaurants and coffee shops, wine bars, and music venues. It is surrounded by Crown Heights on the south, Clinton HIll on the West and Williamsburg on the North.

It's very diverse, lively and accessible. Without question, it has the highest percentage of amazing independently-run and reasonably-priced restaurants, bars, clubs and cafes. It also has a ton of independent boutiques, vintage shops, record shops, book stores, and art galleries. It's one of the few places in America where you might be able to walk for a few blocks without running into a single multinational McDonald's, Subway, KFC, etc.	Just to be clear, we are renting rooms out in our 3 bedroom home, during times in which one or more of us are traveling. If you're looking for a slightly less personal and unique hospitality experience, perhaps a hotel room would be a better fit! What staying with us will give you is the experience of what it feels like to live in one of the best apartments in one of the most interesting neighborhoods in the world. But if it's amenities and a concierge service that you require, this may not be for you.	The 2nd Avenue F Train is 4 minutes away, the Astor Place 6 train is 8 minutes away and the 1st Avenue L Train is 8 minutes away. There are express buses running up and downtown on 1st and 2nd Avenues. And there are numerous Citibike locations nearby. In short, it's a great place to land when you come to visit NYC.	Guests have access to private fire escape/terrace of the room, back deck, rooftop, kitchen, living room, bathroom, etc.	Regardless of whether I'm traveling or not, I'm generally very accessible via text, email or other apps. We are all helpful and pleasant but quite busy in our own lives. We just ask that guests are respectful of our time and space and we will do the same!	Cleanliness, respect of other's privacy, keeping noise levels down at night/in the morning and communication are important.			https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/22011644-b8a7-48a2-b385-648b69dfd4a0.jpg?aki_policy=large		4396	https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/4396	Casey	2008-11-19	New York, New York, United States	I work as a freelance photographer and run an arts non-profit, Slideluck.

Due to previous experience, PLEASE communicate if your check-out time is not at a business hour ( i.e. if you need to check out within the hours of 12 am- 7am)  PRIOR to booking so that you may be checked out properly.  Otherwise, a small deposit in the form of returnable/ voidable check will be requested for security/ damages possibility in the event that noone is able to check you out in person.   During the summer months, there may be an energy cost surcharge of $100 due to past experience with travelers that have a different idea of energy consumption than our own.  We consider this a cool, spacious apartment with 11 windows that if used well can create a lovely ambient environment and believe that air conditioners should NEVER be left on when noone is at home.

Bushwick graffiti and street art tours happen daily as well as many artists run art galleries, cafes and bars.		Easy to get around in Bushwick.

Also 5-10 min walk to the L train that goes directly into Manhattan  and crosses Manhattan to connect with many other subway trains. We're a 5 min walk to the JMZ subway lines.	You access the building at the front door where there is a small entry, to your immediate left is the door to the apartment. Guests can easily access the two art galleries and the laundry facility through the back room of the galleries.	I live and work nearby so I am very available. My sculpture studio is one block away. My art gallery is adjacent to our home and I live upstairs from the apartment. Also in the neighborhood, many venues like  restaurants cafés and homeowners, have my decorative artistic  metal work.

Ask before using the laundry machines and plan to provide your own detergent. Separate recycling from your trash: paper and cardboard are separate from plastic, glass and metal.

It still has a bit of graffiti and grit and is full of vibrant ethnic enclaves but is very safe and you simply won't find a younger, funner place in NYC. The apartment is steps to great restaurants (probably the best in the city), bars (definitely the best in the city), cafes, and anything else you could want.  Within a few minutes' walk you'll find: a huge arcade bar, a whiskey-slash-grilled-cheese bar, the most famous steakhouse in the country, dirt-cheap dives, incredible speakeasy cocktail bars, and the best pizza place in NYC.	"Please have a great time! And even though the area is lively and a lot of fun, the apartment itself is VERY quiet, in case that's a concern. Oh, and it's a walk-up/no elevator. All guests must be able to climb stairs with their bags. Same day guests must message me before Instant Booking to confirm availability, and checkin may be later than the listed time if we can make it work. Through Spring of 2020, the L train (nearest subway) will be undergoing long-term maintenance, resulting in slightly longer waits late at night and on weekends. The trains will still be running (the ""L Train Shutdown"" you may have heard about was actually canceled), and should be operating normally on weekdays, making the impact minimal to non-existant. Still, guests should be aware of this!"	The subway (L train) is literally around the corner (you don't even need to cross the street) and is quick and very safe—even late at night. You can get just about anywhere in the city in minutes. Union Square is about 10 minutes away, the East Village about 7 minutes. It really is about as convenient a location as you'll find for getting around.  We also have several CitiBike bike-share stations within steps of the building. For $10 a day (or a longer-term subscription), you get unlimited access to these bikes, parked throughout the entire city.  The neighborhood itself is also very walkable, with tons to do, eat, shop, and drink in the immediate vicinity. Be like the locals and walk!	Guests have access to an enormous and beautiful apartment in a great part of town, steps from the subway. Your private room has a private balcony, and is on a completely separate floor from where I sleep (meaning tons of privacy). You have your own bathroom, access to the kitchen, living room, and pretty much whatever else you like. You can come and go as you please, 24 hours a day, and you won't disturb me. I also offer free laundry with overnight drop-off service for guests staying at least six nights.	That's up to you! If you'd rather I didn't exist, I understand. If you want to grab a beer and talk about your trip and getting the most out of NYC, I'm happy to (assuming I'm not slammed with work)! There are also occasions when I have to travel at the last minute. So if I have to skip town for work, I apologize, and hope you enjoy the private apartment!	"-All guests must read the full listing (particularly the sections labeled ""The Space"" and ""Other things to note"") BEFORE booking.

I provide excellent customer service, clean rooms in a great neighborhood, all in a beautiful apartment in the best city in the world, New York City!"	within a day	100%	85%	f	https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/72062/profile_pic/1405562308/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small	https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/72062/profile_pic/1405562308/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium	Alphabet City	4	4	['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews']	t	f	New York, NY, United States	Manhattan	East Village	Manhattan	New York	NY	10009	New York	New York, NY	US	United States	40.7254	-73.98156999999999	t	Apartment	Entire home/apt	6	2.0	2.0	4	Real Bed	"{TV,""Cable TV"",Internet,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",""Wheelchair accessible"",Kitchen,""Smoking allowed"",""Pets allowed"",Doorman,Gym,Breakfast,Elevator,Heating,Washer,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",Essentials,Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""Host greets you""}"	700.0	$350.00			$500.00	$75.00	2	$25.00	2	60	1	2	60	60	1.9	60.0	2 days ago	t	13	26	48	309	2020-02-12	8	1	2010-06-08	2020-01-12	91.0	10.0	9.0	10.0	10.0	9.0	10.0	f			f	f	strict_14_with_grace_period	f	f	4	3	1	0	0.07
