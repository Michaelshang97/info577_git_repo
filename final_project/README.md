Project Name
Airbnb price prediction

Project Intro
The business goal of this project is to utilize many predicators to accurately predict 
the Airbnb price for new households in New York City. Lots of new household owners who are 
new to the business may wonder what price should they charge for their property, 
this question will be addressed in this model. I will use supervisied machine learning 
methods to build an predictive pricing model to let the household owners set proper
prices for their new listings.

Methods Used
*Exploratory data analysis
*Data Visualization
*Predictive Modeling


Technologies
*Python3
*Jupyter

Project Description
The data source of this project is collected from (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)
I will use exploratory data analysis first and then apply the following modeling techniques: 
linear regression, random forest regression, xgboost regression and multilayer perceptron
regression to accurately predict prices for new Airbnb households.
